// <h1>Getting Ready: Planning And Metrics Link</h1>
// <p>Micro-optimizations are great for keeping performance
// on track, but it's critical to have clearly defined
// targets in mind — measurable goals that would influence
// any decisions made throughout the process. There are a
// couple of different models, and the ones discussed below
// are quite opinionated — just make sure to set your own
// priorities early on.</p>
// <h2>Establish a performance culture.</h2>
// <p>In many organizations, front-end developers know
// exactly what common underlying problems are and what
// loading patterns should be used to fix them. However,
// as long as there is no alignment between dev/design
// and marketing teams, performance isn't going to sustain
// long-term. Study common complaints coming into customer
// service and see how improving performance can help
// relieve some of these common problems.</p>
// <p>Run performance experiments and measure outcomes —
// both on mobile and on desktop. It will help you build up
// a company-tailored case study with real data. Furthermore,
// using data from case studies and experiments published on
// WPO Stats can help increase sensitivity for business about
// why performance matters, and what impact it has on user
// experience and business metrics. Stating that performance
// matters alone isn't enough though — you also need to
// establish some measurable and trackable goals and observe them.</p>
